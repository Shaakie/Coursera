                to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens in
                comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs chicken meat and
                chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.

              <p>
                Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric
                times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them.
                Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred
                specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat.
